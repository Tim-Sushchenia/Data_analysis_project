### **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis**  

This project focuses on the analysis of Netflix movies and TV shows using a dataset containing information about titles, genres, release years, ratings, and other relevant attributes. The primary objective is to explore patterns, trends, and correlations in the dataset while applying machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.

### **Technologies and Libraries Used**  

#### **Data Handling and Processing**  
- `pandas`, `numpy`  

#### **Data Visualization**  
- `plotly.graph_objects`, `plotly.express`, `seaborn`  

#### **Machine Learning**  
- **Linear Regression**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest**

### **Key Analysis and Insights**  

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Distribution of movies vs. TV shows over the years  
- Most common genres and their frequency  
- Trends in content production over time  
- Relationship between ratings and content type  

#### **Data Visualization**  
- Interactive charts using `plotly` to illustrate trends and patterns  
- Heatmaps with `seaborn` to show correlations between different attributes

### **Machine Learning Implementation**  

#### **Predicting Movie/TV Show Popularity**  
- Built classification models (**Logistic Regression, Random Forest**) to predict the popularity of a title based on its attributes.  

#### **Regression Analysis**  
- Implemented **Linear Regression** to analyze the impact of different factors (e.g., release year, duration) on content ratings.  

#### **Feature Selection and Model Evaluation**  
- Used different **feature engineering** techniques to optimize model performance.  
- Evaluated models using **accuracy, precision, recall**, and **RMSE** for regression models.
